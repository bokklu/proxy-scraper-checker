# Proxy-Scraper-Checker
A simple proxy scraper that scrapes and filters thousands of public proxies from the web

This 'Proxy-Scraper-Checker' is basically a scheduler that will execute periodic jobs to check for public proxies.
Every job will scrape and ping/check proxies asynchronously and collect additional information on the proxy.

Every proxy will have the following statistics generated by our checker:

- address
- country
- proxy access type
- proxy type
- proxy speed
- proxy uptime
- proxy location information

The Proxy Location information entails the following properties:

- internet service provider id
- internet service provider name
- region
- timezone
- latitude/longtitude co-ordinates
- postal code
- location accuracy radius

The proxies are then saved to an external PostgreSQL database.

# Requirements:

- asyncio
- aiohttp
- aiohttp-socks
- asyncpg
- schedule
